# The Bank Tech Test

### Introduction

:money_with_wings:

This is my solution to the Bank Tech Test (requirements listed below).

It is written in Javascript and test-driven using Jasmine. I have also added a basic interface using jQuery, which can be accessed by typing `open index.html` in your terminal.

### Requirements
* Deposits, withdrawal
* Account statement (date, amount, balance)
* Statement printing

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see  


```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

### Additional extensions

* Statement filters (just deposits, withdrawals, date ascending, date descending)
* Graphical interface
